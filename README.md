Child Vaccination Management System

Young children are at increased risk for infectious diseases because their immune systems have not yet built up the necessary defences to fight serious infections and diseases. Making sure that children have access to proper healthcare and immunization against diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, is a huge challenge that is being faced by developing countries like ours. This highlights the importance and need of having a better, smarter system in place, to improve the situations. This application provides a system to provide information, store records and help parents schedule vaccination appointments for their children.

It's user-friendly.

The system helps to book appointments for their child's vaccination easily.

Parents can view their updates and also their reminders for appointments.
